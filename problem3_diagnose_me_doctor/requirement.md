# Task

Provide steps to troubleshoot two production issues.

### Scenario

You are working as a DevOps Engineer on a cloud-based infrastructure where a virtual machine (VM), running Ubuntu 24.04, with 64GB of storage is under your management. Recently, your monitoring tools have reported that the VM is consistently running at 99% memory usage. This VM is responsible for only running one service - a NGINX load balancer as a traffic router for upstream services.

### Challenge

Describe how you would troubleshoot the issue, and what causes/scenario do you expect to encounter, as well as what are the impacts and recovery steps for each possible root cause.
